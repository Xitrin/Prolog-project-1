# Prolog-project-1
Prolog project for Artificial Intelligence class

Prolog project -> .pl  files are actual prolog files with Knowledge bases and rules, while .txt files are testing queries to show how the code works

recursion.pl includes 3 types of rules: add, convert and grep.
1. add makes the list(2nd input) either the same or shorter depending on first input and then returns the result OR checks if rule holds using other variations
2. convert converts numbers written with letters(for ex 1 is one) to numbers. So (one,two,three) -> (1,2,3)
3. grep looks through the list and retrieves needed word's position in the list if there is any.
